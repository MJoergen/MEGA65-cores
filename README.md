# M2M demo cores

The purpose of this repo is to give examples of (simple) cores for the MEGA65 based on the
MiSTer2MEGA platform. This latter platform makes many tasks easier, in that the framework
provides convenient interface to
* HDMI output
* Keyboard interface
* External memory (HyperRAM or SDRAM)
* On-Screen Menu

## life
This is [Conway's Game-Of-Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simulator.

## queens
This solves the [N-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle),
i.e. placing N queens on an N-by-N chess board, such that no queens can see each other.

## voronoi
This generates a nice visual effect using [Voronoi
patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

## mandelbrot
This provides a real-time rendering of [Mandelbrot
images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) with continuous zoom and pan.
